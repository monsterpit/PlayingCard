            //It wont stroke and fill the reason for that is when we draw in an context , it's actually slightly different than using that UIBezierPath
            //In context when we do strokePath like this it consumes the path. It uses up the path
            //so when we do the fillPath on the next line , there's no path. We have to start again
            // so thats the one of the biggest advantage of UIBezierPath
